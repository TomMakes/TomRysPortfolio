      <div > <p class="step1" id="story1Intro">Here we have a stacked bar chart giving an overview of what percentage of fatal collisions have occured due to speeding. </p>
             <p class="step1"  id="story1Intro2">As you can see, Ohio has a relatively low percentage of collisions due to speeding. </p>
             <p class="step1.5"  id="story1Intro3">It is higher than Nebraska </p>
             <p class="step1.5"  id="story1Intro4">But much less than Hawaii </p>

        <p class="step2" id="story2Intro"> This particular chart displays the percent of collisions that have happened by people who were not distracted.</p>
        <p class="step2" id="story2Intro2"> In this case, the higher percent is better.</p>
        <p class="step2" id="story2Intro3"> Ohio does well with 99%, let's see a state that is not doing so well now. </p>

        <p class="step3" id="story3Intro"> Now lets take a look at a bad state like Texas. ^</p>
        <p class="step3" id="story3Intro2"> Each state you visit will be highlighted so you know which ones you've visited.</p>
        
        <p class="step4" id="story4Intro"> Texas has both a high rate of speeding drivers, as well as a high rate of alcohol use. </p>
        <p class="step4" id="story4Intro2"> While the level of distracted drivers is low, it doesn't make up for the other reckless behaviors. </p>
        <p class="step4" id="story4Intro3"> There are no clear winners for the worst state, but this analysis highlights <br> states that are clearly 
          more reckless than others, and there are some that <br> are very safe like Minnesota.</p>
        <p class="step4" id="story4Intro4"> Looking by geographical region, there is no clearly dangerous or safe area. <br>
        Although the south seems to have a high amount of incidents.</p>
